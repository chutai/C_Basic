# C_Basic
In file stack_maze.h 
I define enum direction variable include RIGHT,LEFT, UP, DOWN AND ..._NEXT
Because Im want to find two ways to exit the maze. 
First, My priority is turn RIGHT, and then priority is turn DOWN. 
In function Maze_Solve(...., enum direction dir) 
Parameter dir is priority that I implying.
